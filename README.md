OurMusic is a social music web app that allows users to create and join music rooms. Users can add music to a synchronized playlist using a Youtube supported search bar and upvote and downvote songs in the queue. A local room chat window also allows for conversation within rooms. The app was created using a host of web technologies which include Bootstrap, jQuery, Javascript, ASP.NET, SignalR, and the Youtube API.
